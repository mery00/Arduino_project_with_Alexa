# Arduino_project_with_Alexa
Project for computer science master class "Lab of Internet of Things". This project combines two different type of Arduino(Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2 and Arduino MKR WiFi 1010) and Alexa, in addiction to other type of sensors, in order to create a smart system for a domotic house.
The idea is to create an energy saving system for the house, and an antigas and fire prevention system.
You can find all information about the project in the paper [Lab of IoT Documentation](https://github.com/mery00/Arduino_project_with_Alexa/blob/master/Lab_of_Iot_documentation.pdf).

After downloading the project, move the files with the commit description **"Files about Alexa, and antigas and fire system"**, 
in a folder that is equivalent to an Arduino IDE project, and connect this project to the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board.
